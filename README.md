# Decision-Tree-Classification-on-Iris-Dataset
Application of Decision Tree Algorithm on the famous Iris Dataset (In Python)

## NOTE: This task is completed as a part of The Sparks Foundation GRIP Internship program in Data Science and Business Analytics domain

We used an example Iris dataset of flowers with three categories to train our algorithm and classifier with the goal of having it be able to predict the correct class when given fresh data.

Iris data has a total of six characteristics, four of which are independent (SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, and PetalwidthCm) and one of which is dependent or a target variable (Species). As a serial number for each data point, the Id column is also there. Target variable contains class labels, and all Independent characteristics have not-null float values (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).

We may say that our Iris data is a balanced dataset because each class (species) has an equal amount of data points. In our sample, no Class completely dominates.

We used Matplotlib and seaborn as a Python libraries to visualize the dataset. To show the data for better understanding, there are numerous plots available, including scatter, hist, bar, and count.

Using already-existing features, I'm only trying to identify some new ones here. Utilizing the differences between each attribute to obtain further information, plots were used to illustrate it.

Using the graphviz package, I constructed a decision tree model for classification.
